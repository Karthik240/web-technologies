		It is part of the basic policy of the promoters that infrastructural <br>
		self-sufficiency is a pre-requisite for better productivity and performance in all the activities,<br>
		more so for academic activities. The Management has always been creating and updating academic and <br>
		building infrastructure to meet the AICTE norms and standards from time to time and to make life easy <br>
		and stress-free in the campus.<br>
		Today the campus resembles a park with well laid out black-topped internal roads with avenue trees on<br> 
		either-side. The one k.m. approach road too is a beauty to watch. Every bit of the vacant space is<br> 
		covered with lawns, flower plants and gardens. It is a most environment friendly campus, full of<br> 
		greenery, the hills on the western side adding to the contrast of the panorama.<br>
