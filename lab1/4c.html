		In Hinduism, it is traditionally recognized as the abode of Shiva, who resided there along with his <br>
		consort goddess Parvati and their children, Ganesha and Kartikeya.<br>
		In the Uttara Kanda section of the epic Ramayana, it is said that Ravana attempted to uproot the<br>
		Mount Kailash as retaliation to lord Shiva, who in turn, pressed his right big toe upon the mountain,<br>
		trapping Ravana in between.[13] This version of lord Shiva is also referred to as Ravananugraha,<br>
		or favour form to Ravana while seated in mount Kailash.<br>
		According to the epic Mahabharata, it is said that the Pandava brothers, along with their wife Draupadi,<br>
		trekked to the summit of mount Kailash on their path to liberation, as it is considered to be a gateway to Heaven,<br> also known as Swarga Loka.
		According to Charles Allen, one description in the Vishnu Purana of the mountain states that its four<br>
		faces are made of crystal, ruby, gold, and lapis lazuli.[15] It is a pillar of the world and is located<br>
		at the heart of six mountain ranges symbolizing a lotus.[15]<br>
